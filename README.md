# API Journal

## Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to experience the power of the web by developing a web application just as attractive as native mobile apps with the help of web API's.

# 🪐 Week 1

### Concept
For the assignment we had to choose a app concept we wanted to remake with API's. I was immediately drawn to the idea of recreating an e-commerce or wishlist app. 

### API Research
#### Content API
For my API research I wanted to use an e-com content API with products I could use for the wishlist app. After checking out many API's, and almost two days passing by due to intensive research and reading documentation, I could only find suitable API's for payment or extremely limiting ones. API's I wanted to use in the first place or that I have considered where h&m API, Zara(home) API, Farfetch API, Bol API, Amazon API, Etsy API
I came to the conclusion that using the Pinterest API would be best suitable for my concept. But not knowing yet exactly what capabilities I have and what functions or ideas I can develop for my app with it, I had to adjust and adapt my concept a bit. To somewhat more general, like an app people can use their pins within.

#### Web API
The web API's that got my attention where the canvas API, color picker and view transitions. Not sure yet of what their capabilities are and what I can achieve with them, I decided to first start working with my content API and later implementing the web API for functionalities.
